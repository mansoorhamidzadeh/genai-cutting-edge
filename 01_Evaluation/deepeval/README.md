# DeepEval: Comprehensive Overview

## Introduction

DeepEval is an open‑source evaluation framework tailored for large language models (LLMs). It brings the discipline of software engineering—such as unit testing, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and performance monitoring—into the AI domain. By providing structured tests, clear metrics, and automated reporting, DeepEval helps teams verify model behavior, track improvements, and ensure reliability every step of the way.

## What Is DeepEval?

DeepEval treats LLMs like software: instead of manually sampling outputs, it lets you define precise test cases and metrics. Each test evaluates a specific model behavior—for example, factual accuracy, relevance, or ethical compliance—and returns a numerical score. Over time, these scores form a clear record of your model’s strengths and areas for improvement.

## Core Principles

* **Unit-Test Style**: Write isolated checks for discrete behaviors (e.g., “Does the model answer fact-based questions correctly?”).
* **CI/CD Integration**: Incorporate evaluations into your development pipeline to catch regressions before they reach production.
* **Automated Monitoring**: Continuously track model performance using preconfigured dashboards and alerts.
* **Reproducibility**: Ensure every test run is identical, enabling consistent comparisons across model versions.

## Key Features

1. **Extensive Metrics Library**
   Over 30 built‑in, research‑backed measures covering accuracy, relevance, coherence, toxicity, and more. Metrics are customizable to domain‑specific requirements.

2. **Flexible Evaluation Scopes**

    * **End-to-End**: Validate complete workflows, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines or multi-turn dialogues.
    * **Component-Level**: Isolate and test individual modules—retrievers, generators, summarizers, or tool-invoking agents.

3. **Synthetic Data Generation**
   Automatically create and evolve edge‑case test examples, ensuring comprehensive coverage without manual data curation.

4. **Scalability & Performance**
   Support for parallel test execution and seamless integration into CI/CD pipelines, delivering fast feedback on large test suites.

5. **Centralized Reporting**
   Visual dashboards via the Confident AI platform enable regression tracking, collaborative review, and alerting on performance deviations.

6. **Safety & Red‑Teaming**
   With the companion DeepTeam package, perform adversarial “red‑team” exercises to expose biases, toxicity, prompt injections, and security vulnerabilities.
